What libraries support building knowledge graphs, creating vector embeddings, performing vector assisted RAG queries, and performing vector with graph assisted GraphRAG queries?  1. Consider  Neo4j neo4j-graphrag python package (https://neo4j.com/docs/neo4j-graphrag-python/current/  and its doc https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j-graphrag-python Has support for vectors in Neo4j, Weaviate, Pinecone, and Qdrant. KG building with SimpleKGPipeline or support for custom pipelines https://neo4j.com/docs/neo4j-graphrag-python/current/user_guide_kg_builder.html), 2. LangChain,  3. LlamaIndex, 4. Spring AI.  5. LangChain.js, 6. LangChain4j, 7. LangChain.dart . 8. What about others?    9. Create a a table with all libraries:  a. In what specific vector databases, graph databases, and search databases (Elasticsearch, OpenSearch) can it create vectors in (do a complete  a though check) b. List all specific graph databases the library can build  knowledge graphs in. c. What class does the KG building. d. What class does the GraphRAG search.

Based on the search results, here's a comprehensive analysis of libraries that support building knowledge graphs, creating vector embeddings, and performing GraphRAG queries:

## Major Libraries for GraphRAG

### **Neo4j GraphRAG Python Package**

The Neo4j GraphRAG Python package provides comprehensive GraphRAG capabilities with support for knowledge graph creation through pipelines that extract entities from unstructured text, generate embeddings, and create graphs in Neo4j[^2]. It includes multiple retrievers for graph search, vector search, and integration with vector databases[^2].

### **LangChain**

LangChain offers extensive GraphRAG capabilities with the `GraphCypherQAChain` for generating Cypher queries and retrieving data from graph databases[^15]. It supports both vector similarity search and graph query bifurcation for property graphs[^15].

### **LlamaIndex**

LlamaIndex provides the **Property Graph Index**, which enables richer modeling, storage, and querying of knowledge graphs compared to traditional knowledge triples[^9]. It supports labeled property graphs with metadata and hybrid search capabilities[^9].

### **Spring AI**

Spring AI integrates with vector databases and provides standardized interfaces for working with vector stores[^11]. It supports knowledge graph integration through specialized query languages like Cypher[^12].

## Comprehensive Comparison Table

| Library | Vector Database Support | Graph Database Support | KG Building Class | GraphRAG Search Class |

| **Spring AI** | Multiple via standard interface[^11] | Neo4j (via Cypher)[^12] | Custom implementations | Custom query engines[^12] |
| **LangChain.js** | Memory, Chroma, FAISS, others[^13] | Neo4j[^14] | Custom extractors[^14] | Similar to Python version |
| **LangChain4j** | Neo4j (embedded)[^16] | Neo4j[^16] | Custom implementations | `Neo4jText2CypherRetriever`[^16] |

## Graph Database Support Analysis

### **Neo4j-Focused Libraries**

Most libraries primarily support **Neo4j** as their main graph database due to its popularity and Cypher query language support[^2][^6][^9][^12][^15][^16].

### **Multi-Database Support**

- **LlamaIndex**: Supports multiple graph stores through `PropertyGraphStore` abstraction, including in-memory, disk-based, and Neo4j[^9]
- **LangChain**: Primarily Neo4j but extensible architecture allows custom graph database connectors[^6]


## Knowledge Graph Building Classes

### **Neo4j GraphRAG Python**

- **Primary**: `SimpleKGPipeline` - simplifies knowledge graph building from text documents[^4]
- **Custom**: Support for custom pipeline implementations[^2]


### **LlamaIndex**

- **Schema-Guided**: `SchemaLLMPathExtractor` - extracts entities based on predefined schemas[^9]
- **Free-Form**: `SimpleLLMPathExtractor` - infers entities and relationships directly[^9]
- **Implicit**: `ImplicitPathExtractor` - uses node relationships[^9]


### **LangChain**

- **Flexible**: Custom extractor implementations for different use cases[^14]
- **Integration**: Works with various LLMs for entity extraction[^15]


## GraphRAG Search Classes

### **Neo4j GraphRAG Python**

- **Vector Search**: `VectorRetriever` for similarity-based retrieval[^2]
- **Hybrid**: `VectorCypherRetriever` combining vector and graph traversal[^2]
- **Full Pipeline**: `GraphRAG` class for end-to-end workflows[^3]


### **LlamaIndex**

- **Multi-Modal**: `VectorContextRetriever`, `LLMSynonymRetriever`, `CypherTemplateRetriever`[^9]
- **Hybrid Search**: Combines vector similarity with graph structure[^9]


### **LangChain**

- **Primary**: `GraphCypherQAChain` for Cypher query generation and execution[^15]
- **Workflow**: `StateGraph` for complex multi-step GraphRAG workflows[^15]


## Additional Notable Libraries

### **Specialized KG Libraries**

- **PyKEEN**: Knowledge graph embeddings with PyTorch[^19]
- **AmpliGraph**: Machine learning models for knowledge graph embeddings[^19]
- **Pykg2vec**: Knowledge graph embedding algorithms with TensorFlow/PyTorch[^19]

These specialized libraries focus specifically on knowledge graph embeddings but may require additional integration work for full GraphRAG pipelines compared to the comprehensive frameworks listed above.
